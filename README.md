Solution to 2016 CA Water Board Data Innovation Challenge

# Working with CDEN data for data challenge

The California water board announced a [Data Innovation Challenge](http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/resources/data_databases/docs/wb_datainvtn_flyer.pdf) calling for creating "apps, visualizations, and other tools that can help better harness data that is currently
available". 

I want to apply some key lessons I've learned in working with and thinking about data portals, apps, and APIs. Some of the principles are focusing around particular themes, enabling developers to do creative things with the data, enabling others to access data specific to their communities. Simplicity.

### Climate Change Adaptation Challenges


1. Changing water acidity: As the world’s oceans absorb increased atmospheric CO2 and pH falls, oceans are becoming more acidic at an alarming rate – almost 10 times faster than at any other time over the past 50 million years.
    * Using our datasets and others, what are the implications of this expected change?
    * What can we do to adapt better to this expected change?
2.  Changing sea level and storm surge: As polar ice caps melt, median sea level is projected to rise by another foot or more over the next 35 years, and storm surge could become more severe and frequent.
    * Which facilities regulated by the Water Boards are in the most vulnerable areas of the State?
    * How should we prioritize our compliance evaluation and enforcement priorities to properly respond to facilities and their related feepayer needs?

3.  Changing surface water flow patterns: As rainfall patterns change, dry areas are expected to get drier and rainy seasons are expected to become shorter and more intense. In addition, snow melt will occur earlier, further altering river flow patterns.
    * Where can we expect the most biological effects of this change in rainfall amount and pattern across the State?
    * What happens to high mountain meadows and transitional areas in our Sierra mountain range and Coast range with these changes?
4.  Changing water temperature: As global atmospheric temperatures gradually rise, the water column temperature has been increasing about 15 times faster than at any other time in the past 10,000 years.
    * Has river and lake temperature changed much already?


### Regulatory Oversight Challenges

Through our annual Performance Measures report, we measure outputs of our regulatory efforts, but have yet to widely demonstrate the outcomes of these efforts.

* Do bioassessment measures, such as the California Stream Condition Index (CSCI), correlate with the number of violations recorded that are associated to the given location?
* Do enforcement actions change water quality?
* What tools that encourage citizen participation help in our goal of associating regulatory activity with water quality outcomes?


### Societal Water Quality Challenges

Some of the following questions may be addressed using our existing datasets, especially when combined with other data and information available around the state, country and world.

* Using our datasets and others, how much trash comes from different parts (cities, facilities, regions) in California?
* Does trash differ by region, city, and socioeconomic factors?
* Do all Californians seem to consume the same amount of pharmaceuticals or CEC indicators related to pharmaceuticals?
* Are indicators of human waste (e.g., caffeine) available in our datasets that, along with other information, could be used to better detect and describe the CEC problems in our waters?


### Available Datasets

There seems to be only one publicly available dataset without login: California Environmental Data Exchange Network [CEDEN](http://www.ceden.org/). I already requested a full data download which I'll soon make available.
